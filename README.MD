This project is for learning about sorting and searching algorithms

The following have been implemented from scratch:

### Comparison Sorts
1. Bubble Sort (and optimised bubble sort)
2. Selection Sort
3. Insertion Sort
4. Partition Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Bucket Sort
7. Heap Sort - initially attempted by creating an actual tree data structure, but tried again and was successful by using the index relationships to operate on an array object rather than a tree/node object
8. Shell Sort
### Non-Comparison Sorts
1. Counting Sort
2. Radix Sort - to-do!
